# UI/UX Trade Offs & Design Changes:

## Using Boilerplate vs Starting From the Ground Up
### Pros
- Templates (Boilerplates, etc) have been used by professionals in everyday work, so using one is reasonable.
- Using Templates mimicks real world work
  - Companies/Clients will have their own aesthetic and basic web design. Working with boilerplates is similar to that.
  - Working with boilerplate would allow me to work with foreign ui; dealing with systems that I wouldn't initially be familiar with, learn what makes it work, and improve it while retaining what made the design good in the first place.
- Generative tools (AI) can make it easier to start from scratch, narrowing the percieved gap in skill.

### Cons
- Using a boilerplate, means that I wouldn't have started from the ground up.
